- List

* Dynamic length
* Hetrogenous data types (Multiple data types) 
* indexing 
*          * positive indext start from 0 to n-1
*          * negative index starts from -1 to length
* Slicing
*          * variable: name[start:end:step]
*          * start : int = include data 
*          * end   : int = exclude data
*          * step  : int = skip some elements/sequence

- List Methods

# pop( ) method

* The `pop()` function in Python is used to remove the last element from a list and return it.

# append( ) method in python

* The append( ) method is used to add an item at the end of a list.

# insert( ) method in Python 

* The insert() Method is a built-in string and list data type function in python. It allows you to add an element at any given position

# clear( ) method in Python

* The clear() function is used to remove all the items from a list. It does not return any value, it simply removes all elements from the list

# copy( ) method in Python

* The copy() method is used to create a new object which is a copy of the existing object. It returns a shallow copy of the original
* The copy() method is a built-in function or method used to create a duplicate of an object. It copies the original object and returns it

# count( ) method in Python

The `count()` function is a built-in Python method that returns the number of occurrences of an element within a list. It takes one argument

# extend( ) method in Python
* The `extend()` function is a built-in Python method that allows you to add elements from an iterable (like list, string etc.)

# remove( ) method in Python
* The `remove()` function is a built-in function of Python. It removes the first occurrence of the specified value from the list and returns None

# index( ) method in Python
* The `index()` function is a built-in string and list method in Python. It returns the first occurrence of the specified value from the list

# reverse( ) method in Python
* The reverse() function is a built-in Python method that can be used on any iterable object. It reverses the order of elements in the list

# sort( ) method in Pyhon

* The sort() function is used to sort the elements of a list.
* It doesn't return anything but it sorts the original list.
